MazePCDViewer(June,2018 - October,2018) -
* MazePCDViewer is a web-based internal tool to visualize a massive amount of point cloud data. 
* This tool allows the users to share their data sets with clients or the public without the need to install any third-party applications and transfer huge amounts of data in advance. 
The focus on large point clouds, and a  ariety of measuring tools, also allows users to use Potree to look at, analyze and validate raw point cloud data, without the need for a time-intensive and
potentially costly meshing step.
* Potree converter to convert raw PCD to potree format i.e., *.js

Slope and curvature(November,2018 - January,2019) - 
* Calculate the slope and curvature of a road using the raw GPS data.
* Created a node js package(currently private) of slope and curvature

Autocut(February,2019 - 8th March,2019) - 
Built a video route using the GPS(lat lon) data and photos collected by Gaze(Mobile maping System)(EGO Vehicle).

AIMLDL(11th March,2019 - Till date) -
* Matplotlib(Visualize the stats of dataset i.e., no of labels, no on annotations per label, no of images per label)
* Numpy (Merging 2 or more images, Binary masks)
* YAML creating(Creating config file for training in *.yml file)
* Training
* Predicting
* Evaluating
* Hyperparameters tuning
* Develop automation scripts to run train, evaluate and predict(batch_train.sh, batch_evaluate.sh, batch_predict.sh)
* Flask - Python web application framework to host a DNN trained model in web browser and interact through API. 
* Merging of all the annotation jobs.
