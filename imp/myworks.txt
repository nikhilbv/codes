MazePCDViewer-
MazePCDViewer is a web-based internal tool to visualize a massive amount of point cloud data. This tool allows the users to share their data sets with clients or the public without the need to install any third-party applications and transfer huge amounts of data in advance. The focus on large point clouds, and a  ariety of measuring tools, also allows users to use Potree to look at, analyze and validate raw point cloud data, without the need for a time-intensive and
potentially costly meshing step.
